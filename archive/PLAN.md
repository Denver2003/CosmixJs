# EPIC1 Plan (Physical Tetris MVP)

- [ ] Initialize project base: HTML + Canvas, Matter.js wireframe renderer
- [ ] Build the "glass": static walls + floor with target physics params
- [ ] Add spawn/kill lines (logic + render)
- [ ] Spawn simple shapes with physics tuning
- [ ] Implement settled detection (velocity thresholds + N frames)
- [ ] Add basic controls (left/right/rotate/drop) for testing
- [ ] Check kill line and set game-over state
- [ ] Extract physics parameters into tweakable constants
