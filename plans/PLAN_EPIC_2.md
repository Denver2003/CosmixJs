# PLAN_EPIC_2 — Scoring & Rewards

- [x] Review current chain collapse + level-up flow and locate integration points for rewards/state.
- [x] Implement score/coin state + reward calculations (NR/PR/NLR/MR) and hook them into collapse/level-up.
- [x] Add persisted coins storage (localStorage) with save-on-game-over and load-on-start.
- [x] Add display hooks for score/coins in the HUD layer/state.
- [x] Add score burst text particles that magnetize to the HUD score on collapse.
- [x] Update PROJECT.md to reflect new behavior.
