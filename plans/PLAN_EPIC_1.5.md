# EPIC-01.5 Refactor & Structure Plan

- [x] 1) Add epic doc and plan; confirm scope (no behavior change).
- [x] 2) Extract viewport/fit logic into `scripts/view/` (bootstrap stays in main).
- [x] 3) Extract pause/auto-pause into `scripts/game/pause.js`.
- [x] 4) Split `chains.js` into detection vs. effects modules; keep API stable.
- [x] 5) Update PROJECT.md; ask before touching PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md.
