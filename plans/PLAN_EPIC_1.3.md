# EPIC-01.3 Animation Effects Plan

- [x] 1) Add epic doc and plan; confirm scope.
- [x] 2) Hide control line rendering (keep logic).
- [x] 3) Implement chain-removal burst animation (0.5s, scatter/scale/fade, then delete bodies).
- [x] 4) Add first-impact flash on falling piece (fast fill blink; optional contour spark if feasible).
- [x] 5) Update PROJECT.md; ask before touching PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md.
