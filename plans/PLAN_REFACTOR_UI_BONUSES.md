# PLAN — UI/Bonuses Refactor

- [x] Audit large files and map a target module split.
- [x] Split `lines.js` into focused draw modules (bonus UI, overlays, lines).
- [x] Split `bonuses.js` into focused logic modules (instant/consumable/VFX).
- [x] Smoke-check (runtime render without errors).
## Follow-ups
- [x] Remove left-side bubble icon legend.
- [x] Remove test bonus inventory defaults.
- [x] Adjust bottom level progress fill visuals.
- [x] Update HUD score/coins to single row with icons.
- [x] Persist bonus inventory locally between sessions (save on game over).
- [x] Pause should stop bubble motion/VFX updates.
- [x] Add level-up popup animation (NEW / LEVEL / number stack).
